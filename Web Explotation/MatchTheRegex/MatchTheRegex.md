# Description

How about trying to match a regular expression

The website is running here.

# Solution

For me this was just trial and error using regex and looking at the source code.

The comment in the source code gives a very big hint into what it is.

```// ^p.....F!?```

I used many different expersions and eventually got to input "picoCTF" (case-sensitive) to get the flag.

Flag: ```picoCTF{succ3s...ad436ed}```
